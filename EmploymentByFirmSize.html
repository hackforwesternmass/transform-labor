    	A clear dichotomy exists between how employers are distributed by size relative to where employment is concentrated.

    	Among the 6,602 establishments in Franklin/Hampshire, 62.9% had fewer than 5 employees. These firms, however, accounted for just 7.5 % of all jobs in the region.
    	</p><p class="col-md-4">
    	Reinforcing this dichotomy is that nearly 90% of all establishments in Franklin/Hampshire have fewer than 20 employees but comprise less than 30% of total employment in the region.

		Conversely, the 133 employers in the region with at least 100 employees (1.7%) are responsible for 44% of the workforce areaâ€™s employment.
