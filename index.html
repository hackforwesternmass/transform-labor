<h3><a name=employment-by-size"" class="anchor" href="#employment-by-size"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Employment by firm size</h3>
<p>A clear dichotomy exists between how employers are distributed by size relative to where employment is concentrated.</p>
<p>Among the 6,602 establishments in Franklin/Hampshire, 62.9% had fewer than 5 employees. These firms, however, accounted for just 7.5 % of all jobs in the region.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this dichotomy is that nearly 90% of all establishments in Franklin/Hampshire have fewer than 20 employees but comprise less than 30% of total employment in the region.</p>
<p>Conversely, the 133 employers in the region with at least 100 employees (1.7%) are responsible for 44% of the workforce area's employment.</p>

<h3><a name="journey-to-work" class="anchor" href="#journey-to-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Journey to Work</h3>
    	<p>Two thirds of the region's employed residents work in Franklin/Hampshire. Not surprisingly, Hampden County is the most common commuting destination with nearly 1 in 6 residents working in the county.</p>
    	<div id="j2w-chart"></div>
	    <p>From the employer vantage point, three quarters of their workforce comes from Franklin/Hampshire. This share is larger because of a net outflow of  workers (12,354) from Franklin/Hampshire. In total, 93% of all workers come from Franklin/Hampshire (76%) and Hampden (17%).</p>
